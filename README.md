# q2devtools

This repo contains internal developer tools used by the Caporaso Lab to help with developing QIIME 2. These scripts haven't necessarily been tested and are not guaranteed to be robust or work in all cases. These scripts are not guaranteed to have any sort of lifetime and may change/disappear without warning.

With these caveats in mind, please inspect and understand what a script will do before running it on your system. Some of the assumptions in the scripts may not apply to your development environment and may need to be tweaked.
